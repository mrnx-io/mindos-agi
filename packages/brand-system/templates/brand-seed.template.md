## The Foundation Before Flight

> **LAYER -1** in the Universal Brand System

_Every garden starts with seeds. But the gardener doesn't save seeds by measuring their dimensions. The gardener knows the plant that will grow._

---

## P U R P O S E

This template is not a form to fill. It is a compass to point.

Complete it truthfully, and the Universal Brand System will execute without guessing, without halting, without asking for clarification again. You will have given the system enough ground to build your brand architecture.

The questions that follow are the **minimum viable truth** about your business. Without these answers, the system cannot proceed. With them, it can work autonomously.

> _"Philosophy derives from axiom._
> _Strategy derives from evidence._
> _The Brand Seed is that evidence."_

**Canonical Input**: The system executes from `brand-seed.json` (use `templates/brand-seed.template.json`). This markdown is a human-readable guide; JSON remains canonical.

- [ ] Watering holes are specific places (not "social media" - which platforms?)
- [ ] Wallet evidence proves ability to pay
- [ ] Price corridor has rationale (not arbitrary)
- [ ] Unit economics inputs are present (AOV, margin %, frequency, retention)
- [ ] At least one authority proof exists
- [ ] Founder backstory includes struggle (not just success)
- [ ] Ethical boundaries are explicit

## U S A G E

1. Complete `brand-seed.json` using `templates/brand-seed.template.json` (use this markdown as the guide)
2. (Optional) Generate a human-readable mirror from the JSON for review
3. Provide `brand-seed.json` to the Universal Brand System as Layer -1 input
4. The Covenant (Layer 1) will derive all strategic decisions from this seed

## T H E G U A R A N T E E

With a complete Brand Seed:

> "An AGI reading this protocol and a valid Brand Seed can execute the entire Universal Brand System **without additional human clarification** beyond the seed inputs."

Without a complete Brand Seed:

> "The system will halt and request the missing information. It will never guess."

---

_This is the input contract._
_Complete it truthfully._
_The system will do the rest._
