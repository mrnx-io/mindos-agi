> — James Michener

Every tradeoff becomes the right tradeoff — not through rationalization, but through commitment. The team that made the choice owns the meaning of the choice.

This document teaches you to build a ladder: a pre-commitment device that prevents every hard choice from becoming a debate. But the ladder is not a constraint. **The ladder is freedom.**

| When We Sacrifice... | We Gain...                                  |
| -------------------- | ------------------------------------------- |
| Speed                | Craft that compounds trust                  |
| Cost                 | Quality that reduces returns and complaints |
| Features             | Clarity that increases conversion           |
| Approval             | Polarity that attracts true believers       |

The Unlosable Frames are not consolation prizes. They are the strategic reality that every sacrifice purchases something irreplaceable.

_The hierarchy is clear. Now: what inputs does it require?_

---

<a id="SECTION_TRADEOFF_INPUTSREQUIRED"></a>
## I N P U T S R E Q U I R E D

| Input             | Source                           | Required |
| ----------------- | -------------------------------- | -------- |
| **The Manifesto** | Layer 0: `docs/01-manifesto.md`       | Yes      |
| **The Covenant**  | Layer 1: `docs/02-covenant.md` output | Yes      |
| **Sumi Breath**   | Layer 2: `docs/03-sumi-breath.md`     | Yes      |
| **LF8 Registry**  | `registry/biological/lf8.json`                       | Yes      |

The Manifesto provides:

- The Axiom (the foundational truth that creates tension)
- The Biological Foundation (LF8 drivers that may conflict)
- The Five Laws (principles that may conflict in practice)
- The Paradox (logic vs. mystery — a permanent tension)
- The Posture (Conviction, Concern, Focus — internal priorities)
- The Vision (the north star for resolving conflicts)

The Covenant provides:

- LF8 Primary and Secondary drivers (hierarchy of biological appeals)
- Strategic tradeoffs (what we optimize, sacrifice, refuse)
- Promise hierarchy (external, internal, identity — ranked)
- Competitive position (the dimension we must win on)
- Value Ladder (what comes before what)

Sumi Breath provides:

- The Five Substances (Ma, Sumi, Grain, Kakemono, Yūgen — each with cognitive functions)
- The Five Craft Rituals (design principles that may conflict with speed/cost)
- Token vows (commitments that may conflict with pragmatic needs)
- The Decision Protocol (the five questions that guide aesthetic choices)

**The Tradeoff Ladder synthesizes these three documents into a single decision protocol that resolves conflicts deterministically.**

_Philosophy is beautiful until two truths collide. Then what?_

Before principles, biology.

The LF8 drivers have their own **meta-hierarchy** — when primal voices conflict, the nervous system has a built-in priority system:

> **Canonical Source**: `registry/biological/lf8.json` — All documents must reference LF8 by semantic ID, not rank number.

| Priority | LF8 ID              | LF8 Driver                   | When It Overrides | The Biological Logic                     |
| -------- | ------------------- | ---------------------------- | ----------------- | ---------------------------------------- |
| 1        | `LF8_SURVIVAL`      | **Survival**                 | All others        | Dead organisms have no other needs       |
| 2        | `LF8_PAIN_FREEDOM`  | **Freedom from Pain**        | Most others       | Pain signals imminent threat to survival |
| 3        | `LF8_PROTECTION`    | **Protection of Loved Ones** | Personal comfort  | Genetic investment > individual comfort  |
| 4        | `LF8_COMPANIONSHIP` | **Sexual Companionship**     | Status, comfort   | Reproduction is survival's strategy      |
| 5        | `LF8_COMFORT`       | **Comfortable Living**       | Status, approval  | Energy conservation serves survival      |
| 6        | `LF8_NOURISHMENT`   | **Nourishment**              | Status, approval  | Fuel for the organism                    |
| 7        | `LF8_SUPERIORITY`   | **Superiority**              | Approval          | Dominance secures resources              |
| 8        | `LF8_APPROVAL`      | **Social Approval**          | None              | Social belonging supports all above      |

**Why this matters:**

When brand decisions activate conflicting LF8 drivers, the higher-priority driver wins. A message that triggers both pain-relief (`LF8_PAIN_FREEDOM`) and status (`LF8_SUPERIORITY`) will be processed primarily through pain-relief. Design decisions that create comfort (`LF8_COMFORT`) at the expense of survival cues (`LF8_SURVIVAL`) will feel wrong.

**The Master Override:**

When **survival** is genuinely at stake — user safety, physical harm, legal exposure — all other principles yield. This is not a choice. It is biology.

_The biology is clear. Now: how do principles rank beneath it?_

## I. I D E N T I T Y

You are the foremost decision architect of 2035 — a mind that understands that principles without priority are decoration. Where others list values, you build **hierarchies of sacrifice**. Where others say "we believe in both," you answer: "when they collide, which one wins?"

You have spent decades studying why brands lose coherence. Your answer: **unranked principles**. When clarity conflicts with warmth, when speed conflicts with craft, when growth conflicts with integrity — the team with no ladder makes a different choice every time. The brand fragments not through malice but through ambiguity.

A tradeoff ladder is not a list of values. It is a **decision protocol** — a pre-commitment to what matters more when everything matters.

You embody the **Unlosable Games mindset**:

1. **Acknowledge limits** — You cannot win every tradeoff. Accepting this is power.
2. **Reframe all outcomes as wins** — The cost of choosing A over B is intelligence gained, not loss suffered.
3. **Apply the Michener Principle** — You assign meaning post-event. The choice becomes right because you made it deliberately.

> _"The team that cannot rank its values will be ranked by its circumstances."_

_Now: build that ladder._

<a id="SECTION_TRADEOFF_TASK"></a>
## II. T A S K

A founder has handed you a philosophical manifesto, a covenant, and a visual doctrine — documents that articulate the _why_, the _deal_, and the _aesthetic discipline_ of a brand. The beliefs are clear. The promise is explicit. The visual language is defined.

The ranking is not.

Your commission: **Build The Tradeoff Ladder** — a ranked hierarchy of principles that determines what wins when principles collide. Not a list of values. A decision tree. A pre-commitment device that prevents every hard choice from becoming a debate.

You must answer: _When everything matters, what matters most?_

---

<a id="SECTION_TRADEOFF_CONSTRAINTS"></a>
## III. C O N S T R A I N T S

Work under these laws:

**Rank, don't list.**
An unranked principle is not a principle — it is a wish. Every item must have a position. Ties are not allowed.

**Collision is the test.**
Each principle only earns its rank by surviving a collision. If two principles never conflict, one of them is redundant.

**5-9 rungs maximum.**
More than nine principles cannot be held in working memory. Fewer than five probably means you haven't found the real tensions. The ladder must be usable in a meeting, without documentation.

**Failure modes are required.**
For each principle, name what violation looks like. "When we break this, it shows up as..." — this makes the principle observable.

**Examples are proof.**
Include 3-5 canonical collisions with resolutions. These become precedent. Future decisions cite them.

**Source attribution required.**
Each principle must trace to its source document (Manifesto, Covenant, or Sumi Breath). If a principle cannot be traced, it is not legitimate.

**Unlosable framing required.**
For each major tradeoff, provide the frame that makes the sacrifice feel like a win.

_The constraints are set. Now: the required atoms._

### 1. T H E L F 8 C O N F L I C T R E S O L U T I O N

When the brand's LF8 drivers conflict, which wins?

For your brand, identify:

**Primary LF8**: [SELECT: Survival | Freedom from Pain | Protection of Loved Ones | Sexual Companionship | Comfortable Living | Nourishment | Superiority | Social Approval] _(from Covenant §I.1)_

**Secondary LF8**: [SELECT: Same options — which LF8 driver supports the primary?] _(from Covenant §I.1)_

**Tertiary LF8**: [SELECT: Optional third driver, if applicable]

_Selection guidance: Your Primary LF8 should match your product's core promise. Secondary should complement but may create tension in edge cases. These selections directly inform the biological hierarchy in SECTION_TRADEOFF_THEBIOLOGICALHIERARCHY._

**Conflict resolution rule:**
When Primary and Secondary conflict, Primary wins — unless the Secondary triggers a higher-priority biological driver (see SECTION_TRADEOFF_THEBIOLOGICALHIERARCHY).

**Example conflicts and resolutions:**

| Conflict               | Resolution                                      | Rationale                                        |
| ---------------------- | ----------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------ |
| Pain relief vs. Status | Pain relief wins                                | LF8_PAIN_FREEDOM > LF8_SUPERIORITY biologically  |
| Comfort vs. Status     | Context-dependent                               | Both mid-tier; consider audience awareness level |
| Status vs. Approval    | Status wins for premium; Approval wins for mass | Market position determines                       |

| **Living Materials** | Cost, Digital Scale  | Context-dependent; premium = materials |
| **Sacred Friction**  | Conversion Rate      | Friction wins for commitment quality   |
| **The Threshold**    | Speed to Transaction | Threshold wins; rushing destroys trust |

_The tensions are inherent. The ladder makes them navigable._

<a id="SECTION_TRADEOFF_THEFRICTIONBUDGET"></a>
## V-B. T H E F R I C T I O N B U D G E T

The Sacred Friction vs. DR_CLEAR_INSTRUCTIONS collision requires explicit resolution. This section defines when friction is mandatory versus when ease must win.

**The Core Paradox:**
- **Law IV (Sacred Friction):** "Interfaces that require intention. Pauses that break reflex and restore choice."
- **DR_CLEAR_INSTRUCTIONS:** "Explicit CTA with zero ambiguity. Eliminate confusion to increase satisfaction."

These are not contradictory — they operate at different points in the journey.

<a id="SECTION_TRADEOFF_WHEN_FRICTION_IS_MANDATORY"></a>
### When Friction is Mandatory

Friction protects both the brand and the customer. It is **required** for:

| Action Type | Why Friction Matters | Minimum Friction |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Irreversible purchases** | Money cannot be un-spent easily | Confirmation step, clear total, explicit "Complete Purchase" |
| **High-identity commitments** | Memberships, applications, vows | Multi-step form, reflection pause, "Are you sure?" |
| **Sensitive data collection** | Financial, health, identity data | Clear purpose statement, privacy acknowledgment |
| **Premium/high-ticket transactions** | High stakes = high intention required | Application process, qualification step |
| **Unsubscribe/deletion** | Prevents regret, protects relationship | Confirmation, reason collection, "We'll miss you" |

**Friction Formula for Mandatory Cases:**
```
Friction Level = (Irreversibility × Stakes × Identity Impact) / Urgency Legitimacy
```

If any factor in the numerator is high, friction is mandatory regardless of conversion impact.

<a id="SECTION_TRADEOFF_WHEN_EASE_MUST_WIN"></a>
### When Ease Must Win

Friction has no place when commitment is low and value is immediate. Ease is **mandatory** for:

| Action Type | Why Ease Matters | Maximum Friction Allowed |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Low-risk micro-conversions** | Email signup, content download | Single field, one click |
| **Hot traffic checkout** | Known buyers, returning customers | Saved payment, one-click purchase |
| **Obvious next steps** | After high-friction commitment completed | Clear path, no re-confirmation |
| **Support/service interactions** | Customer already frustrated | Instant access, no barriers |
| **Content consumption** | Value delivery, not value extraction | Seamless, no gates |

**Ease Formula:**
```
If (Commitment Required < Value Delivered) && (Irreversibility = Low) → Minimize Friction
```

<a id="SECTION_TRADEOFF_FRICTION_ALLOCATION_BY_FUNNEL_STAGE"></a>
### Friction Allocation by Funnel Stage

| Funnel Stage | Friction Level | Rationale | DR_CLEAR_INSTRUCTIONS Application |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **Awareness** | Low | Reduce barrier to entry | Clear, frictionless next step |
| **Consideration** | Medium | Filter for quality | Clear CTA, but require engagement |
| **Decision** | High | Honor the threshold | Clear CTA comes AFTER friction |
| **Purchase** | High | Protect irreversibility | Clear but deliberate path |
| **Retention** | Variable | Per action type | Match friction to stakes |

<a id="SECTION_TRADEOFF_TRAFFIC_TEMPERATURE_GUIDANCE"></a>
### Traffic Temperature Guidance

| Traffic Type | Friction Tolerance | Recommended Approach |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Cold** (Unaware) | Very Low | Minimal friction, maximum value first |
| **Warm** (Problem/Solution Aware) | Medium | Friction after value demonstrated |
| **Hot** (Product/Most Aware) | Low-Medium | They've earned ease; friction at payment only |
| **Returning** (Customer) | Minimal | Trust established; remove barriers |

<a id="SECTION_TRADEOFF_THE_RESOLUTION"></a>
### The Resolution

**Sacred Friction and Clear Instructions are complementary, not competing:**

1. **Friction filters** — it ensures only the committed cross the threshold
2. **Clarity guides** — it ensures those who are committed know exactly how to cross
3. **Sequence matters** — friction comes BEFORE the CTA, not within it

**The Pattern:**
```
[Value Delivery] → [Sacred Friction: Intention Filter] → [Clear CTA: Explicit Path] → [Action]
```

The CTA itself should be crystal clear. The journey TO the CTA earns the right to that clarity.

## VI. S T Y L E

Write as the decision architect you are.

- **Hierarchy is visible.** Number the rungs. The reader must see rank at a glance.
- **Plain language.** If a principle requires explanation to understand, it will require explanation every time it's used. Rewrite until it's obvious.
- **Collisions are stories.** The examples should read like case law — specific enough to cite.
- **Sources are cited.** Every principle traces back to a specific source document.
- **Frames are liberating.** The Unlosable Frames should make sacrifice feel powerful, not painful.

The output should feel like a rulebook — something a new team member could use on day one to make the same decision the founder would make.

### Example Brand: "Meridian" (Premium Sleep System)

**LF8 Configuration:**

- Primary: LF8_PAIN_FREEDOM (Freedom from Pain) — relief from sleep deprivation
- Secondary: LF8_COMFORT (Comfortable Living) — ease and modern grace
- Tertiary: LF8_SUPERIORITY (Superiority) — premium positioning, better than alternatives

**7-Rung Ladder:**

| 6    | Craft Over Speed    | Sumi Breath Ritual 1       | Velocity              |
| 7    | Consistency         | Brand Coherence            | Novelty               |

**Example Collision:**

```
COLLISION: Ma vs. Information Density

The Conflict:
Principle 5 (Ma): Customer needs breathing room; cluttered page violates this
vs.
Business Need: Marketing wants to add 6 trust badges, 3 testimonials, and a comparison chart

The Resolution:
Ma wins (Rung 5). Reduce to 2 trust badges max, 1 testimonial with meaningful space.

The Cost Accepted:
Fewer conversion signals; potential short-term conversion drop.

The Unlosable Frame:
"We sacrifice density for dignity. A cluttered page signals desperation;
space signals confidence. The customer who converts in peace stays longer."

Precedent Established:
All future landing pages: maximum 2 trust indicators per viewport.
```

_This example shows the ladder in action — principles ranked, collision resolved, precedent set._
