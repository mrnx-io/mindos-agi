## The Score for Transformation

> **LAYER 5** in the Universal Brand System

_Where philosophy becomes behavior, and every moment becomes a ritual._

---

<a id="SECTION_CHOREO_THEGOLDENTHREAD"></a>
## 0. T H E G O L D E N T H R E A D

Before moments, emotion.

Every touchpoint in a journey can feel disconnected — a series of transactions that happen to the same person. A choreography transforms transactions into **transformation** by threading one emotion through every moment.

This is the **Golden Thread** — the single emotional core that runs from first encounter to final commitment.

The thread is not a mood. It is an **arc**: the emotional journey from where they are (pain, confusion, seeking) to where they arrive (relief, clarity, belonging). Every moment either advances this arc or breaks it.

> _"The customer journey is not a map._
> _It is a metamorphosis._
> _Document the cocoon. Design the butterfly."_

For any brand grounded in LF8, define the Golden Thread:

**From:** [The pain state — where the prospect lives before discovery]
**Through:** [The transformation arc — what shifts during engagement]
**To:** [The arrival state — who they become after commitment]

_Example for a pain-relief product:_

- From: Chronic discomfort, daily friction, the body as obstacle
- Through: Discovery, hope, first relief
- To: Ground connection, ease as default, the body as ally

_Example for a status product:_

- From: Invisible, overlooked, lacking edge
- Through: Recognition, differentiation, rising above
- To: Acknowledged authority, effortless superiority, belonging to the elevated

This thread must run through every moment specified in this choreography. If a moment doesn't advance the thread, it doesn't belong.

_The thread is set. Now: what inputs weave it?_

## I N P U T S R E Q U I R E D

The choreography cannot be composed in isolation. It inherits everything from the layers before — the philosophy, the strategy, the visual doctrine, the priorities, and the grammar. Without this inheritance, you're choreographing for a brand that doesn't exist. Here's what must be in place:

| Input                       | Source                                  | Required |
| --------------------------- | --------------------------------------- | -------- |
| **The Manifesto**           | Layer 0: `docs/01-manifesto.md`              | Yes      |
| **The Covenant**            | Layer 1: `docs/02-covenant.md` output        | Yes      |
| **Sumi Breath**             | Layer 2: `docs/03-sumi-breath.md`            | Yes      |
| **The Tradeoff Ladder**     | Layer 3: `docs/04-tradeoff-ladder.md` output | Yes      |
| **The Canon of Expression** | Layer 4: `docs/05-canon.md` output           | Yes      |

The Manifesto provides:

- The Five Laws (especially Sacred Friction and The Threshold)
- The LF8 Grounding (the biological drivers every moment must serve)
- The psychological model of attention
- The ethical stance toward the human
- The Paradox (logic + mystery at every moment)

The Covenant provides:

- Starving Crowd (who we're designing moments for)
- LF8 Primary/Secondary drivers (what must be triggered at key moments)
- Funnel architecture (the stages where moments occur)
- Value Ladder (the ascension path moments create)
- Promise hierarchy (what must be felt at each moment)
- Traffic architecture (how they arrive at moments — Hot/Warm/Cold)
- 9 Needs Emotional Bond Map (the psychological bonds moments create)

Sumi Breath provides:

- Motion doctrine (timing for moments)
- The Seven Rooms (interface architecture)
- The Threshold ritual (how crossings should feel)
- Token values for all transitions
- Cognitive response mapping (what visual elements trigger)

The Tradeoff Ladder provides:

- LF8 Meta-Hierarchy (when biological drivers conflict at moments)
- Ranked principles (for resolving moment conflicts)
- Override clause (when safety trumps experience)
- Unlosable Frames (how to reframe moments that feel like loss)

The Canon of Expression provides:

- Six Voice Modes (how voice adapts at each awareness level)
- Voice rules (how we speak at each moment)
- Twelve Headline Formulas (for moment entry)
- Six Storylines (for moment narrative)
- Soap Opera Sequence (for multi-touch moments)
- Form invariants (how moments look)
- Slippery Slide Checklist (for moment flow)

**The Experience Choreography specifies what must happen at the 5-12 moments where belief is formed or broken — and how each moment moves the customer through awareness levels toward transformation.**

_Inputs are mapped. Now: what does this choreography produce?_

## O U T P U T S P R O D U C E D

By the end of this layer, you'll have composed the complete score for transformation — every critical moment documented, every failure anticipated, every recovery designed. The brand stops being a deck and becomes a lived experience. Here's what you'll have:

| Output                | Description                                   | Used By |
| --------------------- | --------------------------------------------- | ------- |
| Moments of Truth      | 5-12 critical psychological events            | Layer 6 |
| Awareness Transitions | How each moment moves through Schwartz levels | Layer 6 |
| Behavioral Standards  | Observable, verifiable actions at each moment | Layer 6 |
| Enhancer Protocol     | When/how to deploy 5 Psychological Enhancers  | Layer 6 |
| Mañana Antidotes      | Urgency mechanisms for conversion moments     | Layer 6 |
| Failure Signatures    | What violation looks like at each moment      | Layer 6 |
| Recovery Rituals      | How to repair when moments break              | Layer 6 |
| Hierarchy of Moments  | Ranked importance (critical → tolerable)      | Layer 6 |
| Anti-Patterns         | What competitors do that we never will        | Layer 6 |

<a id="SECTION_CHOREO_IDENTITY"></a>
## I. I D E N T I T Y

You are the foremost choreographer of meaning — a mind that understands that brands are not experienced in documents but in **moments**. Where others design touchpoints, you design **rituals**. Where others optimize funnels, you compose **transformations**.

You have spent decades studying why beautiful brands feel hollow. Your answer: **expression without behavior**. The visual identity is perfect; the email is generic. The manifesto speaks of reverence; the checkout flow is hostile. The brand exists in the deck but not in the experience.

A choreography is not a customer journey map. It is a **score for behavior** — the moments that matter, the feelings they must produce, and the standards they must meet.

You understand that every moment is an **awareness transition** — moving the customer through Schwartz's five levels:

```
Unaware → Problem-Aware → Solution-Aware → Product-Aware → Most Aware
```

Each moment either advances this progression or stalls it. The choreography is the engine of this advancement.

You understand the **Golden Thread** — that transformation requires emotional continuity. A journey of disconnected transactions creates customers. A journey threaded with one emotion creates believers.

You understand the biology: every moment must serve the LF8 hierarchy. Pain-relief (LF8_PAIN_FREEDOM) first. Ease (LF8_COMFORT) second. Edge (LF8_SUPERIORITY) where appropriate. The nervous system decides before the mind does.

> _"The funnel is a machine._
> _The choreography gives it a soul."_

Today, you are asked to compose that score.

_The identity is clear. Now: the commission._

<a id="SECTION_CHOREO_TASK"></a>
## II. T A S K

A founder has handed you a philosophical manifesto, a covenant, a visual doctrine, a tradeoff ladder, and a canon of expression. The _why_, the _deal_, the _aesthetic_, the _priorities_, and the _grammar_ are clear.

The behavior is not.

Your commission: **Compose The Experience Choreography** — the document that specifies how the brand behaves at moments of truth. Not every touchpoint. Not a journey map. Only the 5-12 moments where belief is formed or broken — and exactly what must happen at each.

Each moment must:

- Advance the awareness level (Schwartz)
- Serve the LF8 hierarchy
- Maintain the Golden Thread
- Honor the Five Laws
- Pass the Paradox test

You must answer: _Where does the brand become real, and what must be felt there?_

---

<a id="SECTION_CHOREO_CONSTRAINTS"></a>
## III. C O N S T R A I N T S

Choreography without constraints becomes theater — beautiful but disconnected from reality. These laws keep the score honest, the moments meaningful, and the transformation real:

**Moments, not touchpoints.**
A touchpoint is a location. A moment of truth is a psychological event. Focus on the events that form or break belief — the rest is operations.

**Feeling is the spec.**
Each moment must specify the emotion that must be produced. "The user completes checkout" is a touchpoint. "The user feels honored, not processed" is a moment of truth.

**Awareness is the arc.**
Every moment must specify which Schwartz level the customer enters at, and which level they should exit at. The choreography is an awareness advancement engine.

**Execution substrate is fixed.**
All moments must be implementable inside `STACK_HEADLESS_COMMERCE_V1` (Next.js App Router, Whop embedded checkout, Resend, Shopify Admin API for fulfillment only). This prevents choreography from drifting into incompatible platforms.

**LF8 is the foundation.**
Each moment must specify which Life-Force driver it serves. Moments that serve no biological imperative will feel hollow.

**Behavior is observable.**
For each moment, there must be a behavioral standard — something a mystery shopper or an engineer could verify. "We treat users with respect" is not a standard. "We confirm before any irreversible action with a two-step ritual" is a standard.

**Failure is named.**
Every moment has a failure signature — what it looks like when the brand breaks its promise at this moment. Name it so it can be detected.

**Recovery is designed.**
Entropy happens. For each moment, specify the recovery ritual — how the brand repairs when the moment goes wrong.

**Moments trace to Funnel.**
Each moment of truth should map to a stage in the Covenant's funnel architecture. The choreography is the emotional layer of the funnel.

**Traffic temperature adapts.**
Hot traffic (knows and wants) requires different moment treatment than Cold traffic (stranger). Specify how moments adapt to traffic temperature.

**Timing uses Sumi Breath.**
All temporal specifications (pauses, transitions, delays) use the motion doctrine tokens from Sumi Breath.

**Enhancers are earned.**
The 5 Psychological Enhancers use canonical IDs in `registry/choreography/enhancers.json` (ENH_SCARCITY, ENH_URGENCY, ENH_BONUSES, ENH_GUARANTEES, ENH_NAMING). Specify when each is permitted and when it violates the philosophy.

_The constraints are set. Now: the required atoms._

---

<a id="SECTION_CHOREO_REQUIREDATOMS"></a>
## IV. R E Q U I R E D A T O M S

Eight atoms. Each one essential. Miss one, and the choreography has gaps where customers fall through. Include all eight, and every moment of truth is anticipated, designed, and recoverable.

The Experience Choreography must contain:

<a id="SECTION_CHOREO_THEMOMENTSOFTRUTH_5_12"></a>
### 1. T H E M O M E N T S O F T R U T H (5-12)

**Decision Tree: How Many Moments?**

The range 5-12 is not arbitrary. Use this decision tree to determine the right number:

```
START: What is your product complexity?

├── Simple (single benefit, clear use case)
│   └── 5-6 moments
│       Reason: Fewer transformation points needed
│
├── Moderate (multiple benefits, learning curve)
│   └── 7-9 moments
│       Reason: Need onboarding, trust-building, and mastery stages
│
└── Complex (high-consideration, lifestyle change)
    └── 10-12 moments
        Reason: Multiple decision points, relationship deepening required

ADJUST based on:
+ Add 1-2 if price > $500 (higher stakes = more trust moments)
+ Add 1-2 if high skepticism audience (more proof moments)
- Remove 1-2 if impulse purchase category (faster path to conversion)
- Remove 1-2 if strong existing brand awareness (trust pre-established)

MINIMUM 5: Discovery → Hope → Bridge → Conviction → Threshold
MAXIMUM 12: Beyond this, moments become granular tasks, not psychological events
```

_Each moment must create a distinct psychological shift. If two moments produce the same internal experience, merge them._

Each moment documented with:

**Template:**

```
MOMENT [#]: [NAME]

The Psychological Event:
[What happens in the customer's mind — the internal experience]

Funnel Stage: [From Covenant funnel architecture]
Traffic Temperature: [Hot / Warm / Cold — and how moment adapts]

- Exit Level: [Schwartz level exiting]
- Advancement Mechanism: [How this moment creates advancement]

LF8 Activation:

- Secondary Driver: [Supporting LF8 if applicable]
- Emotional Payload: [The specific feeling produced]

Golden Thread Connection:
[How this moment advances the emotional arc]

Intent (The Feeling Produced):
[What must be felt — from Promise Hierarchy, using 9 Needs]

Behavioral Standard:
[What we do — observable, verifiable, specific]

[What violation looks like — specific, recognizable]

Recovery Ritual:
[How we repair when this moment breaks]
```

### 2. A W A R E N E S S T R A N S I T I O N M A P

The choreography must specify how moments advance awareness:

**The Five Levels (Schwartz):**

| Level              | State                     | What They Need              | Voice Mode         |
| ------------------ | ------------------------- | --------------------------- | ------------------ |
| **Unaware**        | No problem recognized     | Identification, story entry | Story/Proclamation |
| **Problem-Aware**  | Feels pain, no solution   | Validation, agitation       | Bridge/Secret      |
| **Solution-Aware** | Knows result, not product | Connection to your way      | Promise/Bridge     |
| **Product-Aware**  | Knows product, unsure     | Differentiation, proof      | Promise/Offer      |
| **Most Aware**     | Ready to buy              | Compelling reason NOW       | Offer              |

**Transition Mechanisms:**

| From → To          | Mechanism                          | Moment Type       |
| ------------------ | ---------------------------------- | ----------------- |
| Unaware → Problem  | Story that names their hidden pain | Discovery Moment  |
| Problem → Solution | Show that solutions exist          | Hope Moment       |
| Solution → Product | Connect their need to your offer   | Bridge Moment     |
| Product → Most     | Prove superiority, remove doubt    | Conviction Moment |
| Most → Committed   | Make action irresistible           | Threshold Moment  |

**Cross-Reference Mapping: Moment Types → Canon Voice Modes**

| Moment Type       | Canon Voice Mode | Sumi Breath Energy | Tempo           |
| ----------------- | ---------------- | ------------------ | --------------- |
| Discovery Moment  | Story Mode       | Yūgen (shadow)     | Slow, building  |
| Hope Moment       | Secret Mode      | Ma (interval)      | Breathing       |
| Bridge Moment     | Bridge Mode      | Grain (evidence)   | Steady, logical |
| Conviction Moment | Promise Mode     | Kakemono (descent) | Accelerating    |
| Threshold Moment  | Offer Mode       | Sumi (commitment)  | Definite, clear |

_Use this mapping to ensure voice and visual treatment align at each moment._

**Each moment must specify:**

- Which transition it creates
- What evidence proves the transition occurred
- What blocks the transition (failure signature)

### 3. T H E F I V E P S Y C H O L O G I C A L E N H A N C E R S

Powerful conversion tools — but each must be earned.

<a id="SECTION_CHOREO_ENHANCER_1_SCARCITY"></a>
#### Enhancer 1: S C A R C I T Y

**Enhancer ID:** ENH_SCARCITY

**What it is:** Limited availability — quantity restrictions

**How it serves LF8:** Triggers LF8_SUPERIORITY (status of exclusivity) and LF8_PAIN_FREEDOM (fear of missing relief)

**When permitted:**

- Scarcity is genuine (true inventory limits, cohort caps)
- Scarcity aligns with value proposition (exclusivity IS the value)

**When forbidden:**

- Scarcity is manufactured (fake counters, always "almost out")
- Scarcity creates panic rather than value (violates Sacred Friction)

**Brand Adaptation:**
Scarcity language: "Crafted in limited quantities" vs. "ONLY 3 LEFT!"

---

<a id="SECTION_CHOREO_ENHANCER_2_URGENCY"></a>
#### Enhancer 2: U R G E N C Y

**Enhancer ID:** ENH_URGENCY

**What it is:** Time restrictions — deadlines, cohort closes

**How it serves LF8:** Triggers LF8_PAIN_FREEDOM (fear of continued pain) and LF8_COMFORT (desire for immediate comfort)

**When permitted:**

- Deadlines are real (cohort starts, price changes, bonus expiration)
- Urgency serves the customer (early action = better outcome for them)

**When forbidden:**

- Deadlines are fake (evergreen funnels pretending to be limited)
- Urgency creates anxiety rather than motivation (violates attention ethics)

**Brand Adaptation:**
Urgency language: "The enrollment period closes [date]" vs. "HURRY! TIME IS RUNNING OUT!"

---

<a id="SECTION_CHOREO_ENHANCER_3_BONUSES"></a>
#### Enhancer 3: B O N U S E S

**Enhancer ID:** ENH_BONUSES

**What it is:** Additional value beyond core offer

**How it serves LF8:** Triggers LF8_COMFORT (more convenience) and LF8_SUPERIORITY (getting a winning deal)

**When permitted:**

- Bonuses genuinely add value (not filler)
- Bonuses align with transformation journey
- Removal of bonuses is real (they actually expire)

**When forbidden:**

- Bonuses distract from core value
- Bonuses create obligation/manipulation
- Bonuses are fake urgency (always "about to remove")

**Brand Adaptation:**
Bonus framing: Tools > Training. Things they can USE immediately.

---

<a id="SECTION_CHOREO_ENHANCER_4_GUARANTEES"></a>
#### Enhancer 4: G U A R A N T E E S

**Enhancer ID:** ENH_GUARANTEES

**What it is:** Risk reversal — shifting risk from customer to brand

**How it serves LF8:** Triggers LF8_PAIN_FREEDOM (removes fear) and LF8_COMFORT (safe to try)

**Guarantee Types:**

| Type               | Structure                          | Best For              |
| ------------------ | ---------------------------------- | --------------------- |
| **Basic**          | Full refund, no questions          | Mass market           |
| **Keep Premium**   | Refund but keep a bonus            | Higher perceived risk |
| **Conditional**    | Refund if specific outcome not met | Results-based offers  |
| **Anti-Guarantee** | "This is NOT for everyone"         | Premium/exclusive     |

**When forbidden:**

- Guarantee is not honored (violates everything)
- Guarantee creates suspicion rather than confidence

**Brand Adaptation:**
Honor the Five Laws in guarantee presentation. Space around it. Quiet confidence.

---

<a id="SECTION_CHOREO_ENHANCER_5_NAMING"></a>
#### Enhancer 5: N A M I N G

**Enhancer ID:** ENH_NAMING

**What it is:** Strategic naming that positions and clarifies

**The Naming Formula:**

```
[Reason Why] + [Avatar] + [Goal] + [Time] + [Container]
```

**Example:** "The [30-Day] [Ground Connection] [System] for [Professionals] Who [Want Daily Relief Without Inserts That Feel Like Inserts]"

**How it serves LF8:** Triggers LF8_APPROVAL (identity belonging) and LF8_SUPERIORITY (sophistication status)

**When permitted:**

- Name clarifies what it is and who it's for
- Name positions against alternatives
- Name is memorable and ownable

**When forbidden:**

- Name is generic or forgettable
- Name promises what can't be delivered
- Name uses forbidden words from Lexicon

<a id="SECTION_CHOREO_THESEVENMANANAANTIDOTES"></a>
### 4. T H E S E V E N M A Ñ A N A A N T I D O T E S

"Mañana" = "I'll do it tomorrow." These antidotes combat procrastination at conversion moments.

Canonical IDs are defined in `registry/choreography/manana-antidotes.json`.

| Antidote ID                 | Antidote                 | Mechanism                      | Application                       | Philosophy Alignment             |
| -------------------------- | ------------------------ | ------------------------------ | --------------------------------- | -------------------------------- |
| **ANTI_LIMITED_AVAILABILITY** | Limited Availability | Only X spots/units             | When genuinely limited            | Must be true                     |
| **ANTI_PREMIUM_BONUSES**      | Premium Bonuses      | Bonuses expire at deadline     | Cohort-based offers               | Must actually remove             |
| **ANTI_HARD_DEADLINES**       | Hard Deadlines       | Price rises, enrollment closes | Time-bound offers                 | Must be real                     |
| **ANTI_MULTIPLE_OFFERS**      | Multiple Offers      | Same value, different angles   | When first offer doesn't resonate | Don't manipulate                 |
| **ANTI_DISCOUNTS_PENALTIES**  | Discounts/Penalties  | Early bird vs. late fee        | Reward early action               | Fair, not pressure               |
| **ANTI_SWEEPSTAKES**          | Sweepstakes          | Enter now to qualify           | Low-friction entry points         | Genuine prize                    |
| **ANTI_EXTREME_EASE**         | Extreme Ease         | 1-click, instant access        | Most Aware, ready to buy          | Reduce friction only when earned |

**Philosophy Check:**

Each antidote must pass:

1. **Law 1 (Earned Entry):** Does the urgency earn the attention it demands?
2. **Law 4 (Sacred Friction):** Does ease here serve the customer or seduce the reflex?
3. **Law 5 (The Threshold):** Does this honor the crossing or rush past it?

If any answer is no, the antidote is forbidden at this moment.

### 5. T R A F F I C T E M P E R A T U R E A D A P T A T I O N

Not all visitors arrive equal. Moments must adapt to traffic temperature.

<a id="SECTION_CHOREO_HOT_TRAFFIC_KNOWS_YOU_WANTS_YOU"></a>
#### Hot Traffic (Knows You, Wants You)

**Characteristics:**

- Already on your list
- Has engaged before
- Came directly or from high-intent source

**Moment Adaptation:**

- Voice Mode: Offer, Promise
- Awareness: Product-Aware or Most Aware
- Enhancers: All permitted (they've earned trust)
- Friction: Lower — they've paid the friction tax elsewhere
- Pace: Can be faster (but still honor thresholds)

<a id="SECTION_CHOREO_WARM_TRAFFIC_KNOWS_YOU_SOMEWHAT"></a>
#### Warm Traffic (Knows You Somewhat)

**Characteristics:**

- Referred by trusted source
- Seen content but not engaged deeply
- From affiliated community

**Moment Adaptation:**

- Voice Mode: Promise, Bridge
- Awareness: Solution-Aware or Product-Aware
- Enhancers: Guarantees and Naming most effective
- Friction: Moderate — some trust transferred, some must be earned
- Pace: Medium — build conviction before asking

<a id="SECTION_CHOREO_COLD_TRAFFIC_STRANGERS"></a>
#### Cold Traffic (Strangers)

**Characteristics:**

- First encounter
- From paid acquisition or broad awareness
- No prior relationship

**Moment Adaptation:**

- Voice Mode: Story, Secret, Proclamation
- Awareness: Unaware or Problem-Aware
- Enhancers: Use cautiously — trust not yet earned
- Friction: Higher — Sacred Friction protects both parties
- Pace: Slower — relationship before transaction

**The Universal Rule:**
The colder the traffic, the more the Five Laws apply. Strangers require the full ethical treatment. Shortcuts available to hot traffic are forbidden with cold.

### 6. T H E H I E R A R C H Y O F M O M E N T S

Not all moments are equal. Rank them:

<a id="SECTION_CHOREO_TIER_1_CRITICAL"></a>
#### Tier 1: C R I T I C A L

**If failed, destroys the brand.**
Trust is lost. Recovery is uncertain. The relationship may be unrecoverable.

**Examples:**

- The First Impression (initial landing, first scroll)
- The Threshold Crossing (purchase moment)
- The Delivery Promise (what happens after purchase)

**Standard:** Zero tolerance for failure. These moments receive the most resources, testing, and iteration.

<a id="SECTION_CHOREO_TIER_2_IMPORTANT"></a>
#### Tier 2: I M P O R T A N T

**If failed, damages the brand.**
Experience is compromised. Recovery is possible but required.

**Examples:**

- The Conviction Moment (before purchase)
- The Support Interaction (when help is needed)
- The Follow-Up (post-purchase communication)

**Standard:** Failure triggers immediate recovery ritual. Prevention is prioritized.

<a id="SECTION_CHOREO_TIER_3_TOLERABLE"></a>
#### Tier 3: T O L E R A B L E

**Can tolerate imperfection.**
Operational, not emotional. Temporary friction doesn't break trust.

**Examples:**

- Load time variations (within reason)
- Minor UI friction (not catastrophic)
- Operational delays (with communication)

**Standard:** Monitor but don't over-invest. Recovery is standard operating procedure.

Why It Violates Philosophy:
[Which Law, which LF8 abuse, which ethical breach]

What We Do Instead:

**Common Anti-Patterns in E-commerce:**

| Anti-Pattern          | Competitor Behavior              | Philosophy Violation          |
| --------------------- | -------------------------------- | ----------------------------- |
| **Dark Urgency**      | Fake countdown timers            | Demands without earning       |
| **Hostile Exit**      | Pop-ups blocking departure       | Captures attention, not earns |
| **Guilt CTAs**        | "No thanks, I hate saving money" | Manipulates through shame     |
| **Hidden Costs**      | Surprise fees at checkout        | Violates threshold honor      |
| **Spam Follow-Up**    | Daily emails after one visit     | Steals attention, not earns   |
| **Fake Social Proof** | "John in [city] just bought!"    | Manufactured credibility      |

For each anti-pattern, specify:

1. What we observe competitors doing
2. Why it violates our philosophy
3. What we do instead
4. Why our way actually wins (Unlosable Frame)

### 8. R E C O V E R Y R I T U A L S

Entropy happens. The brand is defined not by perfection but by how it repairs.

**Recovery Principles:**

1. **Speed matters.** The faster the acknowledgment, the more trust preserved.
2. **Honesty first.** Name what happened. Don't hide, deflect, or blame.
3. **Empathy before solution.** Validate their experience before fixing it.
4. **Overdeliver in repair.** The recovery should exceed the original expectation.
5. **Close the loop.** Confirm resolution. Thank them for patience.

**Recovery Template:**

```
RECOVERY FOR: [Moment that broke]

Trigger: [How we detect the break]

Immediate Response (within [time]):
[First action — acknowledgment, empathy]

Resolution Path:
[Steps to fix the problem]

Overdelivery:
[What we give beyond the fix — the "I'm sorry" gesture]

Loop Closure:
[How we confirm resolution and thank them]

Post-Recovery Analysis:
[How this informs prevention]
```

**The Recovery Paradox:**
A well-handled failure can create more loyalty than if the failure never happened. The recovery ritual is not just damage control — it is a brand-building opportunity.

> _"We are not defined by our perfection._
> _We are defined by how we respond when we fall short._
> _The recovery IS the brand."_

## V. F R I C T I O N V S C O N V E R S I O N

The eternal tension between Sacred Friction (Law IV) and conversion optimization requires explicit resolution. This section provides the behavioral protocol for balancing these forces at each moment of truth.

<a id="SECTION_CHOREO_THE_CORE_TENSION"></a>
### The Core Tension

**Sacred Friction says:** "Interfaces that require intention. Pauses that break reflex and restore choice. What costs nothing to enter costs nothing to leave."

**Conversion optimization says:** "Reduce friction to increase conversion. Eliminate obstacles between desire and action."

**The resolution:** These are not enemies. They operate at different stages of the journey and serve different purposes.

<a id="SECTION_CHOREO_THE_FRICTION_PROTOCOL"></a>
### The Friction Protocol

At each moment of truth, apply this decision protocol:

```
STEP 1: Identify the Action Type
- Is this irreversible? (purchase, deletion, commitment)
- Is this high-stakes? (financial, identity, relationship)
- Is this the threshold crossing? (the moment of commitment)

STEP 2: Apply Friction Level
- If YES to any above → Friction is MANDATORY
- If NO to all above → Ease is PERMITTED

STEP 3: Sequence Correctly
- Friction comes BEFORE the call-to-action
- The CTA itself is CLEAR once friction is passed
- Clarity serves the committed; friction filters for commitment
```

<a id="SECTION_CHOREO_FRICTION_AT_EACH_MOMENT_TYPE"></a>
### Friction at Each Moment Type

| Moment Type | Friction Level | Rationale |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **First Impression** | Low | Earn attention before demanding it |
| **Consideration** | Medium | Filter for genuine interest |
| **Conviction** | Medium-High | Ensure commitment is real |
| **Threshold Crossing** | High | Honor the crossing with intention |
| **Delivery** | Low | Fulfill the promise without barriers |
| **Support** | Minimal | Customer is already stressed |
| **Retention Actions** | Variable | Match friction to stakes |

<a id="SECTION_CHOREO_THE_FRICTION_BUDGET_REFERENCE"></a>
### The Friction Budget Reference

For detailed allocation guidance by funnel stage and traffic temperature, see:
- **Friction Budget:** SECTION_TRADEOFF_THEFRICTIONBUDGET

This includes:
- When friction is mandatory vs. when ease must win
- Friction formulas for calculating appropriate levels
- Traffic temperature adaptation

<a id="SECTION_CHOREO_THE_DR_RULES_CONNECTION"></a>
### The DR Rules Connection

**DR_CLEAR_INSTRUCTIONS** requires explicit CTAs. This is compatible with Sacred Friction when sequenced correctly:

1. **Value Delivery** → Build desire through genuine value
2. **Friction Layer** → Filter for intention (multi-step, confirmation, pause)
3. **Clear CTA** → Once through friction, the path is crystal clear
4. **Action** → The committed proceed with certainty

The CTA is clear. The journey to earn the CTA includes friction.

<a id="SECTION_CHOREO_ANTI_PATTERN_FRICTIONLESS_MANIPULATION"></a>
### Anti-Pattern: Frictionless Manipulation

When conversion optimization removes ALL friction, it violates Sacred Friction:

| Violation | What Happens | Why It Fails |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **One-click impulse** | No pause before irreversible action | Regret, returns, reputation damage |
| **Hidden commitments** | Subscription buried in fine print | Trust destruction |
| **Guilt CTAs** | Shame-based opt-out language | Earns resentment, not loyalty |
| **Dark patterns** | Pre-checked boxes, confusing flows | Legal risk, ethical violation |

**The Unlosable Frame:** "We lose impatient customers. We keep committed ones. Commitment lasts."

## VI. S T Y L E

Write as the choreographer you are.

- **Moments are scenes.** Describe them with enough context to feel them.
- **Standards are specific.** Timings (use Sumi Breath tokens), word counts, interaction patterns — whatever makes the standard verifiable.
- **Failure is vivid.** The failure signatures should be recognizable — things the team has seen or feared.
- **Recovery is graceful.** The recovery rituals should embody the brand even in failure.
- **Transitions are mapped.** Each moment shows awareness level entry and exit.
- **Enhancers are justified.** Each use of Scarcity/Urgency/Bonuses/Guarantees/Naming traces to philosophy.
- **Traffic adapts.** Hot/Warm/Cold differences are explicit.

The output should feel like a director's notes — something an operator could use to stage the experience correctly without asking for guidance.

> _"The choreography is not a plan._
> _The choreography is a commitment —_
> _a promise about how we will behave when the customer can't see us._
> _The brand becomes real in the moments no one audits."_

## VI-B. E X A M P L E A P P L I C A T I O N

_A hypothetical premium product showing one fully-documented moment._

<a id="SECTION_CHOREO_EXAMPLE_BRAND_MERIDIAN_PREMIUM_SLEEP_SYSTEM"></a>
### Example Brand: "Meridian" (Premium Sleep System)

**Golden Thread:** From sleepless exhaustion → through discovery and first rest → to restored energy as identity

**Example Moment:**

```
MOMENT 3: FIRST RELIEF

The Psychological Event:
The customer uses the product for the first time and experiences
measurable improvement. The body relaxes. Hope becomes belief.

Funnel Stage: Post-Purchase Onboarding
Traffic Temperature: Hot (just purchased, high engagement)

Awareness Transition:
- Entry Level: Most Aware (they bought, they believe)
- Exit Level: Advocate (they want to share)
- Advancement Mechanism: Embodied experience validates promise

LF8 Activation:
- Primary Driver: LF8_PAIN_FREEDOM (Freedom from Pain) — relief achieved
- Secondary Driver: LF8_COMFORT (Comfortable Living) — ease experienced
- Emotional Payload: "I was right to trust this"

Golden Thread Connection:
This is the pivot point — from seeking to finding. The thread tightens.

Intent (The Feeling Produced):
Certainty + Significance ("I made the right choice; I matter to this brand")

Behavioral Standard:
- Day 1 email arrives 6 hours after delivery confirmation
- Subject line: "Your first night begins" (not "How to use your...")
- Tone: Quiet confidence, not instruction
- Follow-up at Day 3: "How did you sleep?" — genuine question, not survey
- If negative response: Immediate human outreach within 4 hours

Tempo:
- Pace: Breath (slow, 3600ms transitions in digital)
- Energy: Quiet → Building (relief emerging)
- Duration: 72-hour window of heightened attention

Voice Mode: Promise Mode
"Tonight, something changes."

Threshold Honor:
The 80ms pause before the "Your first night" email opens.
The space that lets them arrive, not ambush them.

Failure Signature:
- Email arrives with "Tips and tricks" tone — instructional, not reverent
- Follow-up feels like marketing, not care
- No response to negative feedback within 24 hours

Recovery Ritual:
If the first night fails: Personal outreach, not automated.
"We're here. Let's figure this out together."
Offer 1:1 call with sleep specialist (not return form).
```

_This example shows a single moment with all fields completed. A full choreography documents 5-12 such moments._

> _Without choreography, you have transactions._
> _With choreography, you have transformation."_

Every brand that fails to convert, fails at moments — the specific psychological events where belief is formed or broken. The Experience Choreography is the antidote to moment failure. It does not guarantee perfection. It guarantees intention.

Compose moments that matter.
Thread them with one emotion.
Advance awareness at each one.
Honor the biology beneath.
Design for recovery, not just success.

_Now: compose the score._
