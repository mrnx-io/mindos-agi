## I N P U T S R E Q U I R E D

The visual doctrine inherits from the philosophy. Without the Manifesto, Sumi Breath becomes arbitrary aesthetics — pretty but groundless. Here's what must be in place:

| Input             | Source                           | Required |
| ----------------- | -------------------------------- | -------- |
| **The Manifesto** | Layer 0: `docs/01-manifesto.md`       | Yes      |
| **The Covenant**  | Layer 1: `docs/02-covenant.md` output | Optional |

The Manifesto provides:

- The Axiom (fundamental truth: "Attention is sacred")
- The Biological Foundation (the eight primal voices of the nervous system)
- The Five Laws (Earned Entry, Pregnant Void, Living Materials, Sacred Friction, The Threshold)
- The Paradox (logic + mystery without compromise)
- The Vision (a world that honors attention)

The Covenant (when available) provides:

- Starving Crowd profile (for validation that visual doctrine resonates with their pain)
- Price positioning (premium visual language must match premium pricing)
- Promise hierarchy (visual expression must support the identity promise)
- Awareness level distribution (informing which visual archetypes to emphasize)

**Note:** Sumi Breath principles are universal and derived directly from the Manifesto. Covenant inputs may refine token values for specific market positioning, but never alter the foundational principles.

_This philosophy must have a body. What body can hold attention without gripping it?_

## 0. T H E P R E M I S E

When creation becomes frictionless, "content" becomes cheap.
What remains holy is the nervous system.
Therefore design is not decoration. Design is **entropy work**.

**Sumi Breath** is the method for doing that work:

- **Sumi**: decisive ink—commitment that signals certainty.
- **Breath**: Ma—interval as mercy for the processing mind.
- **Truth**: materials that age, friction that grounds, thresholds that become ritual.

But we must be precise: WHY does ink calm? WHY does space heal? The answer lies not in aesthetics but in neuroscience.

_The nervous system is not arbitrary. What does it actually need to feel safe enough to pay attention?_

---

<a id="SECTION_SUMI_BREATH_THENEUROAESTHETICAXIOM"></a>
## I. T H E N E U R O A E S T H E T I C A X I O M

**Attention is sacred. Every demand on consciousness must be earned.**

This is not poetry. This is **biology**.

The nervous system runs a continuous calculation: **threat vs. reward**. Every visual stimulus triggers this assessment. Every pixel is a micro-demand on a system designed for survival, not consumption.

**The Eight Visual Responses:**

| LF8 Driver                       | ID                  | Visual Threat                | Visual Resolution          |
| -------------------------------- | ------------------- | ---------------------------- | -------------------------- |
| 1. Survival                      | LF8_SURVIVAL        | Visual chaos signals danger  | Order signals safety       |
| 2. Freedom from Pain             | LF8_PAIN_FREEDOM    | Uncertainty creates anxiety  | Clarity provides relief    |
| 3. Protection of Loved Ones      | LF8_PROTECTION      | Instability threatens        | Solidity protects          |
| 4. Sexual Companionship          | LF8_COMPANIONSHIP   | Coldness signals rejection   | Warmth signals welcome     |
| 5. Comfortable Living            | LF8_COMFORT         | Complexity exhausts          | Simplicity restores        |
| 6. Nourishment                   | LF8_NOURISHMENT     | Harsh contrast causes pain   | Warm tones deliver comfort |
| 7. Superiority                   | LF8_SUPERIORITY     | Cheapness signals low status | Restraint signals premium  |
| 8. Social Approval               | LF8_APPROVAL        | Clutter signals chaos        | Ma signals sophistication  |

In practice, this means:

- Every pixel is a request to the nervous system.
- Every request has a metabolic cost.
- Every cost must purchase meaning—or it steals energy.

To demand attention without repayment is **theft from a survival budget**.
So our craft begins with one hard move:

**We do not add to impress. We remove to respect.**

_The axiom is clear. But how do we turn principle into method?_

## II. T H E M E T H O D

<a id="SECTION_SUMI_BREATH_THE_KNIFE_THAT_MAKES_MASTERPIECES"></a>
### The Knife That Makes Masterpieces

**Remove until removal would diminish.**

This is not a preference. It is the synthesis of the lineage: silence, exformation, and marrow.

**Operational rule:**
If you cannot say what would diminish, you do not yet know why it exists—so it does not get to exist.

**The Derivation Chain (Visual):**

```
AXIOM:       Attention is sacred
    ↓
LAW:         (one of the Five Laws)
    ↓
SUBSTANCE:   (one of the Five Materials)
    ↓
TOKEN:       (specific value: color, duration, spacing)
    ↓
APPLICATION: (the visual decision)
```

Every pixel traces back. If the chain breaks, the pixel is arbitrary.

_The method gives us rigor. But can rigor and mystery coexist?_

<a id="SECTION_SUMI_BREATH_THEVISUALPARADOX"></a>
## III. T H E V I S U A L P A R A D O X

The highest design holds two truths without compromise:

**It must be completely logical.**
Every choice traces to first principles. The rational mind finds no loose screws.

**It must be deeply mysterious.**
The experience must exceed its explanation. The emotional response must arrive from what is withheld.

This is **Yūgen** applied to modern design:

- Logic determines **what is present**.
- Mystery emerges from **what is absent**.

> _"The explicable creates trust._
> _The inexplicable creates devotion."_

**The Test:**

A design succeeds when:

- A rationalist finds nothing to criticize
- A poet finds something they cannot fully name

If only one condition is met, the work is incomplete.

_The paradox shapes our aesthetic. Now we must make it craft._

<a id="SECTION_SUMI_BREATH_1_EARNEDENTRY"></a>
### 1) E A R N E D E N T R Y

<a id="SECTION_SUMI_BREATH_THE_ADMISSION_RITUAL"></a>
#### The Admission Ritual

Nothing appears without justification.

Before any element enters a composition, it must answer:

1. What attention does this demand?
2. What does it return that is worth that cost?
3. What would truly diminish if it were removed?

If unclear: it does not belong.

**The Rule of One (Visual):**

This law encodes the fundamental principle: **One Good Idea per view.**

- **One hero per view.** (One primary object for attention to kneel to.)
- **One dominant emotion per screen.** (The LF8 driver made visible.)
- **One clear action per moment.** (No dual CTAs competing at the same hierarchical level.)
- **One story per scroll.** (Vertical descent with narrative unity.)

Multiple heroes dilute. One hero pierces.

**How to enact (non-negotiables):**

- No ornamental elements without function as orientation, rhythm, or meaning.
- Every badge is guilty until proven essential.
- Every illustration must earn its attention cost.

**Psychological truth:** The brain can hold approximately 4 items in working memory. Every additional element past the hero consumes capacity that should have been spent on the message.

Minimalism is not a taste; it is an **obligation to the finite**.

### 2) P R E G N A N T V O I D

<a id="SECTION_SUMI_BREATH_THE_MA_COMPOSITION_RITUAL"></a>
#### The Ma Composition Ritual

Ma is not empty space. Ma is **active interval**—space that allows attention to breathe.
We do not design for density. We design for the exhale.

Exformation teaches: what is omitted becomes potential; the viewer completes the work.

**The Cognitive Function of Emptiness:**

| Space Type  | Cognitive Effect                | Emotional Result |
| ----------- | ------------------------------- | ---------------- |
| Micro-space | Separates elements (parsing)    | Clarity          |
| Meso-space  | Creates grouping (chunking)     | Comprehension    |
| Macro-space | Signals importance (hierarchy)  | Focus            |
| Quiet zone  | Allows processing (integration) | Relief           |

**How to enact (the Ma rules):**

- **Whitespace is a component.** It has a name, a purpose, and a minimum size.
- **Margins are not "leftover."** They are **dignity**.
- **Prefer fewer elements with more room** over more elements with perfect alignment.
- **Allow one deliberate "quiet zone"** per view where nothing asks for attention.

**Psychological truth:** The brain requires cognitive rest between processing bursts. Ma provides this rest. Without it, the viewer's system depletes—and depleted systems make no decisions.

### 3) L I V I N G M A T E R I A L S

<a id="SECTION_SUMI_BREATH_THE_PATINA_RITUAL"></a>
#### The Patina Ritual

Value accrues to what ages.
We reject sterile surfaces that never change; we elevate materials that remember—copper that greens, paper that yellows, concrete that carries light like weather.

**The Trust Function of Texture:**

The nervous system has a survival heuristic: **sterility signals artifice; patina signals reality**.

What shows evidence of existence is believed.
What shows no history is suspected.

**How to enact (material direction):**

- Choose textures with **tooth** (paper grain, linen weave, stone pores), but keep them **quiet** (never louder than content).
- Prefer photographic light that feels **real**: side light, diffuse shadow, imperfect reflection.
- Introduce "time" digitally via restrained micro-noise, slight tonal variance, and warm neutrals—not gimmicks.

**Psychological truth:** The brain encodes effort as value. What required time to make feels worth protecting. What was mass-produced feels disposable. Texture is a signal of investment.

A crack is not a defect; it is a receipt of reality.

### 4) S A C R E D F R I C T I O N

<a id="SECTION_SUMI_BREATH_THE_INTENTION_RITUAL"></a>
#### The Intention Ritual

Resistance grounds; smoothness deceives.
Friction is evidence.

We cultivate interfaces that require intention, small costs that create commitment, and pauses that break reflex and restore choice.

**The Investment Function of Friction:**

The brain has a consistency bias: actions must align with identity. When someone invests effort, they believe more strongly in what they invested in.

**How to enact (friction, ethically):**

- Add friction only where it protects dignity: destructive actions, irreversible commitments, sensitive sharing.
- Replace "Are you sure?" with **clarity**: what will happen, what cannot be undone, what remains safe.
- Prefer **hold-to-confirm** or **two-step rituals** for irreversible actions (not to block, but to honor).
- Never add friction to extract value. Add it to **return agency**.

**Psychological truth:** What costs nothing to enter costs nothing to leave. Friction is not the enemy of conversion—it is the foundation of retention.

### 5) T H E T H R E S H O L D

<a id="SECTION_SUMI_BREATH_THE_RITUAL_OF_CROSSING"></a>
#### The Ritual of Crossing

Every transition is a ritual.
A threshold is not a seam to hide; it is a moment to honor.

**The Identity Function of Crossings:**

Thresholds are where identity reorganizes. The moment of clicking "Buy" is not a transaction—it is a self-statement. The person who clicks is declaring: "I am someone who values this."

**How to enact (threshold design):**

- Give every major action a **before**, a **during**, and an **after**.
- Make state change legible: page turns, sends, purchases—these are psychological crossings.
- Insert the bow: **80ms of stillness** before motion begins. It is not delay; it is respect.

**Psychological truth:** The algorithm optimizes for conversion. We optimize for transformation. The difference is that conversion creates customers. Transformation creates believers.

_The Five Laws create the lattice. Now we must give them bodies._

---

<a id="SECTION_SUMI_BREATH_1_MA_SPACE_AS_IMMUNE_SYSTEM"></a>
#### 1) M A — Space as Immune System

**Visual Function:** Structure through absence.
**Cognitive Function:** Processing rest (prevents attention entropy).
**Emotional Function:** Safety through room.

Space is not leftover. Space is protection.
We remove what spikes urgency; we preserve room for voluntary attention.

**Why it works neurologically:**
The prefrontal cortex requires metabolic recovery between processing tasks. Ma provides micro-rest that prevents cognitive depletion. A design without Ma exhausts before it persuades.

**Practice:**
Design the emptiness first. Place the "quiet zones." Then allow content to enter as guests.

---

<a id="SECTION_SUMI_BREATH_2_SUMI_INK_AS_TRUTH"></a>
#### 2) S U M I — Ink as Truth

**Visual Function:** Commitment through contrast.
**Cognitive Function:** Certainty signal (reduces doubt, increases trust).
**Emotional Function:** Authority through decisiveness.

Ink is commitment. It does not apologize.
Favor near-black over pure black; warm whites over sterile whites.
Color is rare—earned—seasonal.

**Why it works neurologically:**
High contrast creates focal certainty—the eye knows exactly where to go. But pure black on pure white triggers a stress response (too harsh). Near-black on warm white provides direction without aggression.

**Practice:**
Let ink do the work. If you need color to create clarity, the structure is not yet clear.

---

<a id="SECTION_SUMI_BREATH_3_GRAIN_THE_EVIDENCE_OF_REALITY"></a>
#### 3) G R A I N — The Evidence of Reality

**Visual Function:** Texture as authenticity.
**Cognitive Function:** Reality proof (increases believability).
**Emotional Function:** Trust through time-evidence.

Sterility is a lie.
We favor surfaces that show tooth, weave, shadow, time—even on screens.

**Why it works neurologically:**
The brain runs continuous authenticity checks. Smooth, sterile surfaces fail this check—they signal "artificial." Texture signals "real," and what is real is trusted.

**Practice:**
Texture is felt at the edge of perception. If the user notices it loudly, it is not texture—it is noise.

---

<a id="SECTION_SUMI_BREATH_4_KAKEMONO_VERTICAL_DESCENT"></a>
#### 4) K A K E M O N O — Vertical Descent

**Visual Function:** Hierarchy through rhythm.
**Cognitive Function:** Reading momentum (creates the Slippery Slide).
**Emotional Function:** Flow through pacing.

Typography is breath marks in sequence.
Hierarchy is quiet. Leading is generous. The grid is felt, not displayed.
Text appears only when its absence would create confusion.

**Why it works neurologically:**
The eye moves in saccades—quick jumps followed by fixations. Kakemono designs for this pattern: each element pulls to the next, creating momentum. The reader descends the page like a child on a slide—unable to stop until the bottom.

**The Visual Slippery Slide:**

Every section must create a **curiosity seed** that can only be satisfied by the next section.

- Visual elements that continue beyond frame edge
- Incomplete forms that resolve below
- Questions posed in headlines, answered in body
- Rhythmic expectation (established then fulfilled)

**Practice:**
Build reading as descent: title → pause → sentence → pause → paragraph → silence.

---

<a id="SECTION_SUMI_BREATH_5_YUGEN_THE_GRACE_OF_SHADOW"></a>
#### 5) Y Ū G E N — The Grace of Shadow

**Visual Function:** Mystery through concealment.
**Cognitive Function:** Devotion trigger (bypasses logical skepticism).
**Emotional Function:** Reverence through the unsaid.

Not everything must be illuminated.
We reveal by withholding; we design the unsaid.

**Why it works neurologically:**
The brain completes what is incomplete. What you withhold becomes theirs to imagine. What they imagine for themselves, they believe without doubt. Mystery is not absence of information—it is presence of imagination.

**Practice:**
A masterpiece is not fully explained. It is fully supported.

_The five substances form the material palette. But how do they compose into space?_

Everything snaps to Ma. Nothing "floats."

**Rule:** if spacing is not intentional, it becomes accidental urgency.

<a id="SECTION_SUMI_BREATH_THE_BASELINE_RHYTHM"></a>

- Line heights and vertical spacing must share a rhythm.
- The page must feel like architecture, not collage.

<a id="SECTION_SUMI_BREATH_OPTICAL_TRUTH"></a>
#### Optical Truth

Mathematics is not always perception.

- Center by optics, not coordinates.
- Balance mass, not bounding boxes.

- Prefer **fewer weights** (2–3 max).
- Prefer **fewer sizes** with better spacing.
- Increase meaning through **interval**, not volume.

**Kakemono cadence:**

- Titles: generous tracking, deliberate pause after.
- Body: comfortable line length; leading that feels like an exhale.

<a id="SECTION_SUMI_BREATH_SEASONAL_ACCENT_DOCTRINE"></a>
### Seasonal Accent Doctrine

Color is rare—earned—seasonal: one flame against quiet.

**The Psychology of Scarcity:**

When color is everywhere, no color has meaning.
When color is scarce, every appearance becomes an event.

This is the visual application of the **Earned Entry** law: the accent must earn its place.

**Rules:**

- One accent hue per surface (page, screen, poster, room).
- Accents must have a job: orientation, state, emphasis—never decoration.
- Default palette lives in warm whites, ash, ink, shadow.

**The seasonal approach:**

- Choose accents like nature chooses them: sparingly, with consequence.
- A single persimmon note can hold an entire composition.

**How to shoot / select imagery:**

- One subject dominates. Background becomes Ma.
- Light should feel like it comes from somewhere real (window, corridor, cloud).
- Avoid visual sarcasm: no over-processing, no trendy distortion, no ornamental chaos.
- Prefer materials that remember (paper, stone, wood, concrete, linen).

<a id="SECTION_SUMI_BREATH_THE_BOW_BEFORE_MOVEMENT"></a>
### The Bow Before Movement

We design crossings with reverence.
The 80-millisecond pause before animation is a bow.

**The Neuroscience of Motion Timing:**

| Timing  | Duration | Cognitive Function                        | Emotional Effect        |
| ------- | -------- | ----------------------------------------- | ----------------------- |
| **Bow** | 80ms     | Decision threshold (one-syllable thought) | Respect acknowledged    |
| Whisper | 160ms    | Micro-attention span (feedback loop)      | Acknowledgment felt     |
| Breath  | 240ms    | Working memory update cycle               | State change registered |
| Room    | 360ms    | Cognitive reset (complete thought)        | Transformation honored  |

**Why 80ms?**

80 milliseconds is the minimum duration for conscious perception. Below this, motion is subliminal. At this threshold, the nervous system recognizes: "Something is about to happen." The bow gives the brain permission to witness the change.

**Motion rules:**

- Motion is never decoration; it is orientation.
- Motion must clarify hierarchy, space, and consequence.
- Reduce jitter: fewer animations, slower, more meaningful.

**The breath timings (canon):**

- **Bow:** 80ms stillness (before the first motion).
- **Whisper:** 160ms (micro feedback: hover, focus, toggles)
- **Breath:** 240ms (panels, sheets, navigational transitions)
- **Room:** 360ms (page changes with clear threshold)

**Verbal Rhythm Mapping (copy breath):**

- **Bow:** pre-CTA micro-pause line break
- **Whisper:** micro-affirmation sentence
- **Breath:** consequence sentence
- **Room:** short whitespace block before the ask

These are structural cues, not literal timings. The aim is to make prose honor the same thresholds as motion.

**Rule:** motion begins with respect, and ends with relief.

#### The Induction

We have arrived at the frontier where philosophy becomes mechanism.

This is the dangerous moment — where restraint becomes rule, and rule becomes routine. Where vow becomes habit. Where the nervous system stops noticing what once felt deliberate.

Here we make vows. Not because we lack choice, but because we have chosen.

Each token in this canon traces back to a law. Each law traces back to the axiom. If you cannot name the law a token serves, the token is not a vow — it is a habit. And habits decay.

**To accept these tokens is to accept responsibility for their meaning.**

Every time you apply these values, you are saying: _"I believe attention is sacred."_ Every choice to constrain is a choice to respect. Every default you honor is a principle you protect.

_The induction is complete. Now: the five vows._

##### The Vow of Generous Spacing

_Nothing is accidental. Space is protection._

The Ma tokens establish the immune system of your composition. When you choose 8 pixels over 7, you are not being arbitrary. You are saying: _"I trust the nervous system's need for rhythm. I refuse to optimize it away."_

**Why these values matter neurologically:**

The prefrontal cortex requires measurable intervals to separate cognitive tasks. Each space value corresponds to a processing layer:
- 4px = element separation (keeps parsing clean)
- 8-12px = component breathing (allows micro-recovery)
- 16-32px = section boundaries (restarts working memory)
- 48px+ = cognitive rest zones (no further processing happens here)

**The Vow:** _"I will treat whitespace as a component, not as leftover. Every space has a purpose. If I cannot name it, I remove it."_

```json
{
  "ma": {
    "unit": 4,
    "space": {
      "0": 0, "1": 4, "2": 8, "3": 12, "4": 16,

<a id="SECTION_SUMI_BREATH_THE_VOW_OF_COMMITTED_CONTRAST"></a>
##### The Vow of Committed Contrast

_Ink does not apologize._

The Sumi tokens establish certainty in the nervous system. When you choose `#12110F` (near-black) over `#000000` (pure black), you are protecting the eye from stress while maintaining signal strength.

**Why these values matter neurologically:**

High contrast creates focal certainty, but pure black on pure white triggers a stress response — excessive harshness that the visual system interprets as alarm. Near-black on warm white provides direction without aggression. It says _"this matters"_ without shouting.

The warm spectrum (paper, bone, mist) reduces cortisol response. The reader's body relaxes. Relaxed bodies stay longer.

**The Vow:** _"I will use depth over glare. I will choose warmth over sterility. I will let ink do the work. If color is needed to create clarity, my structure is not yet clear."_

```json
{
  "tone": {
    "paper": "#F7F2E8",

<a id="SECTION_SUMI_BREATH_THE_VOW_OF_EARNED_COLOR"></a>
##### The Vow of Earned Color

_One accent per surface. Color as ceremony._

The accent tokens exist to make color rare. When everything is colorful, nothing is important. When color is scarce, color is sacred.

**Why these values matter neurologically:**

Color activates the amygdala — the emotional processing center. Overuse creates habituation; the brain stops noticing. Strategic scarcity creates event: the moment of color becomes a moment of significance.

Persimmon commands action. Pine signals growth. Indigo conveys depth. Gold celebrates achievement. Each earns its place by being withheld everywhere else.

**The Vow:** _"I will treat color as earned entry. One accent per surface. If I need more color to create emphasis, my hierarchy is broken."_

```json
{
  "accent": {
    "persimmon": "#D45A2A",

<a id="SECTION_SUMI_BREATH_THE_VOW_OF_READABLE_CONFIDENCE"></a>
##### The Vow of Readable Confidence

_Words carry. Type recedes._

The type tokens exist to make reading effortless. When typography calls attention to itself, it steals from the message. When typography is invisible, the meaning arrives without interference.

**Why these values matter neurologically:**

Reading is pattern recognition. The visual cortex matches letterforms to stored patterns faster when type is familiar, appropriately sized, and properly spaced. System fonts load instantly. Humanist proportions match natural reading rhythms. Leading creates vertical breathing room for saccadic eye movement.

**The Vow:** _"I will choose readability over style. I will let the message speak, not the font. If someone notices my typography, I have failed."_

```json
{
  "type": {
    "font": {
      "latin": "System Sans (humanist)",

<a id="SECTION_SUMI_BREATH_THE_VOW_OF_THE_80MS_BOW"></a>
##### The Vow of the 80ms Bow

_Movement begins with respect. Movement ends with relief._

The motion tokens exist to honor the threshold of conscious perception. Every transition is a micro-ritual. Every animation is a moment of attention. Respect them or lose them.

**Why these values matter neurologically:**

80ms is the threshold of conscious perception — the minimum duration for the brain to register that something has changed. Below this, motion is subliminal (manipulative). Above this, motion is witnessed (respectful).

The bow delay acknowledges the transition. The whisper confirms the action. The breath completes the thought. The room allows full cognitive processing.

**The Vow:** _"I will begin every motion with an 80ms bow. I will never animate faster than perception allows. If motion feels instant, it is stealing attention rather than earning it."_

```json
{
  "motion": {
    "bowDelay": 80,
    "whisper": 160,
    "breath": 240,
    "room": 360,

<a id="SECTION_SUMI_BREATH_THE_FIVE_VOWS_SUMMARY"></a>
#### The Five Vows: Summary

By accepting these tokens, you take five vows:

1. **No pure black on pure white** — You choose depth over glare; you protect the nervous system from unnecessary stress.
2. **One accent per surface** — You treat color as sacred, earned, rare. You refuse to make everything important.
3. **Whitespace is a component** — You recognize Ma as active interval. You refuse to treat emptiness as failure.
4. **Motion begins with a bow** — You honor the 80ms threshold. You treat transitions as rituals, not utilities.
5. **If a token cannot trace to a law, cut it** — You accept that every default serves a principle. You accept accountability for meaning.

These are not preferences. These are promises.

_If you cannot name the law a token serves, the token is not a vow — it is a temptation._

### The Audit That Prevents Ego

Before any design decision, submit to the Five Questions.

| Law                  | Question                                          |
| -------------------- | ------------------------------------------------- |
| **Earned Entry**     | Does this earn the attention it demands?          |
| **Pregnant Void**    | Does its absence diminish the whole?              |
| **Living Materials** | Will this age with dignity?                       |
| **Sacred Friction**  | Does this ground the human, or seduce the reflex? |
| **The Threshold**    | Does this honor the crossing?                     |

If any answer is no: cut, revise, or return to the axiom.

**The Knife:**
If you cannot name the law an element serves, the element is decoration.
If an element serves no law, it serves ego.

**The Derivation Chain:**

```
AXIOM:       Attention is sacred
    ↓
LAW:         (one of the Five Laws)
    ↓
SUBSTANCE:   (Ma, Sumi, Grain, Kakemono, or Yūgen)
    ↓
COGNITIVE:   (processing rest, certainty signal, reality proof, reading momentum, or devotion trigger)
    ↓
TOKEN:       (specific value: color, duration, spacing)
    ↓
APPLICATION: (the visual decision)
```

If the chain breaks at any point, the decision is arbitrary.

### The Architecture of Irresistible Descent

Every screen must function like a slide: once the viewer begins, they cannot stop until the bottom.

**The principle:** Each element exists only to pull attention to the next element.

**Implementation:**

1. **The Hook Above the Fold**
   One image. One statement. One unresolved tension.
   The viewer MUST scroll to resolve it.

2. **The Curiosity Chain**
   Each section ends with an incomplete thought—
   answered only by the next section.

3. **The Rhythm of Revelation**
   Alternate between:
   - Dense information (text, detail)
   - Breathing room (Ma, imagery)
   - Emotional peak (testimonial, image)
   - Cognitive rest (whitespace)

4. **The Final Slide**
   The CTA arrives not as demand, but as relief—
   the natural conclusion to a journey.

> _"The reader falls through the page._
> _The CTA catches them."_

We refuse to steal attention.
We refuse to shout.

We build work that earns entry through silence,
that gives the body friction enough to believe,
that turns thresholds into rituals,
that leaves room for the soul to arrive.

**We stop optimizing for the algorithm. We start optimizing for the heartbeat.**
